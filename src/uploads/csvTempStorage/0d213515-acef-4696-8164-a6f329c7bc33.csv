1011,X515,Hard,"What is the difference between let, var, and const in JavaScript?","var: Function-scoped and can be redeclared or updated. Variables declared with var are hoisted. let: Block-scoped (limited to the block, statement, or expression) and can be updated but not redeclared within the same scope. It is not hoisted like var. const: Block-scoped and cannot be updated or redeclared. It must be initialized at the time of declaration and is used for constant values.",https://res.cloudinary.com/drwdqdqbg/image/upload/v1728411957/mcqs/pl3nlfnvgva3bedwniy5.png
1011,X516,Easy,How does the this keyword work in JavaScript?,"The this keyword refers to the object that is executing the current function. Its value depends on the context in which it is used: In a regular function, this refers to the global object (window in browsers). In an object method, this refers to the object itself. In arrow functions, this is lexically scoped and inherits from the surrounding context. In strict mode, the value of this remains undefined if not explicitly set.",https://res.cloudinary.com/drwdqdqbg/image/upload/v1728418173/mcqs/q8kqjs26b5nduip1udvq.jpg
1011,X517,Medium,"What is a closure in JavaScript, and how is it used?","A closure is a function that remembers and accesses variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has completed execution. Closures are often used for data encapsulation, function factories, and to maintain state across function executions.",https://res.cloudinary.com/drwdqdqbg/image/upload/v1728418187/mcqs/rnmqbdklhlzrmsl58l47.jpg
1011,X518,Medium,Explain the concept of promises and how they are used in JavaScript.,A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. Promises have three states: Pending: The initial state. Fulfilled: The operation was successful. Rejected: The operation failed. Promises are used to handle asynchronous tasks and are typically chained using .then() for success and .catch() for failure.,https://res.cloudinary.com/drwdqdqbg/image/upload/v1728418201/mcqs/lea0mygegfz4iti1gg3o.jpg
1011,X519,Easy,What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?,(loose equality): Compares two values for equality after converting them to a common type (type coercion). === (strict equality): Compares both value and type without performing type conversion.,https://res.cloudinary.com/drwdqdqbg/image/upload/v1728418217/mcqs/ij305z5vx4pmwgboo8dp.png
